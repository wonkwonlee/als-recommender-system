## Method
- Alternating Least Square (ALS) method is a matrix factorization algorithm which decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices, user factor matrix U and item factor matrix V
- Parallel ALS method is compared to a single-machine implmentation using LightFM


## Evaluation
- MAP: Mean Average Precision
- MAP @ K: Mean Average Precision of top K recommended items
- NDCG: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain of top K recommended items
